# Python-Selenium
A python based selenium framework

I've created a comprehensive Python Selenium testing framework with the following architecture and features:
Framework Structure


Core Components:
Config Management: Environment-based configuration with default values
Driver Factory: Automated driver creation with optimized settings for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
Base Driver: Common WebDriver operations with enhanced error handling
Page Object Model: Clean separation of page logic and test logic
Base Test Class: Setup/teardown with automatic screenshot on failure

Key Features
1. Multi-Browser Support

Chrome, Firefox, Edge with automatic driver management
Headless mode support
Optimized browser configurations for performance

2. Robust Element Handling

Explicit waits with custom timeouts
Multiple wait conditions (clickable, visible, invisible)
Automatic screenshot on element not found
JavaScript fallback for click operations

3. Page Object Model

Clean separation of concerns
Reusable page components
Method chaining support
Built-in logging

4. Advanced Test Features

Automatic screenshot on test failure
Comprehensive logging with timestamps
HTML test reports
Parallel test execution support
Environment variable configuration

5. Enhanced Interactions

Drag and drop operations
Hover actions
Frame/window switching
JavaScript execution
Shadow DOM ready (from previous artifact)

# Usage Examples
bash# Basic test run
pytest tests/ -v --html=reports/report.html

# Different browser
BROWSER=firefox pytest tests/ -v

# Headless mode
HEADLESS=true pytest tests/ -v

# Parallel execution
pytest tests/ -n 4 -v

# Specific test
pytest tests/test_login.py::TestLogin::test_successful_login -v


# Framework Benefits
Maintainable: Clear separation of page logic and test logic
Scalable: Easy to add new pages and tests
Reliable: Built-in waits and error handling
Configurable: Environment-based settings
Debuggable: Comprehensive logging and screenshots
Extensible: Easy to add new browsers or features

The framework follows industry best practices and is production-ready for automated testing projects. You can customize the configuration, add more page objects, and extend the functionality based on your specific testing needs.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Claude can make mistakes.
